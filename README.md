# Ad/cosmetic blocklist
Lists of cosmetic tweaks to sites I use as well as blocking ads. Mostly for personal use but feel free to contribute
I will at this time only actively be supporting [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), and only in whatever capacity I feel like
[Add to ublock origin]("https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnm12/ad-block-lists/main/blocklist.txt&title=bnm12%20Blocklist")
